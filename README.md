## About the project

Tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons are about sharing a collective story.  Part of making that story come alive is having locations, events and characters that feel both fun and authentic to the game.  Most gamemasters will use random tables as prompts to build their adventures.  Such a table might contain a list of twenty items you might find in a goblin’s pocket, fifty horrific diseases, or one hundred personality quirks.

Not every table will work for every game.  Just as a random character from Game of Thrones would seem out of place in a Harry Potter story, not every table will match every game setting.  Lists must be gathered and curated so that they produce results that are random but still feel natural to the game.

Using random tables is nothing new. There are countless collections of amazing lists spread through books, blogs and social media. Cloaked Encounters is designed to let gamemasters collect, edit and quickly access their favorite lists at the press of a button.

In the future, I hope to add features that will allow a community of users to share their favorites with each other.
